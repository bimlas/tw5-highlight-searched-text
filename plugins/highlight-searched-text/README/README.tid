! Highlight searched text

For example, type `search text` in the standard search and select one of the results, or just click outside of it (to hide the popup list): each of ''the words you search for will be highlighted separately in the text of the tiddlers''.

The plugin uses the [[Mark.js library|https://markjs.io/]].
