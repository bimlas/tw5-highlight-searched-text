! Highlight searched text

For example, type `search text` in the standard search and select one of the results, or just click outside of it (to hide the popup list): each of ''the words you search for will be highlighted separately in the text of the tiddlers''.

Since this doesn't require a "Find in page" browser, ''it is convenient to use on [[TiddlyDesktop|https://tiddlywiki.com/#TiddlyDesktop]] and Android'' (via [[Tiddloid|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Saving%20on%20Android]], [[Quinoid|https://github.com/Marxsal/Quinoid01]], etc).

The plugin uses the [[Mark.js library|https://markjs.io/]].

!! Known issues

The "find-in-page" feature does not work properly with [[JD's Material theme|http://j.d.material.tiddlyspot.com/]] because when you jump to the next hit, it will be aligned with the top of the page instead of the middle of the page.

If the text of a tiddler is wider than the story river, it will not align the "find-in-page" toolbar at the bottom of the screen, but more lower, so it will not be visible. For example, search for "script" in the Shadows tab of [[$:/AdvancedSearch]] and make your browser as narrow as possible: if you scroll down and up, you will understand what I mean. This is not a bug in the plugin, but in the TiddlyWiki (or rather in the browsers).

!! Tips

!!! Colorized icons

To colorize the next / previous icons, create a tiddler (name can be anything), add the <<tag "$:/tags/Stylesheet">> tag and copy the following code into it.

```css
.bimlas-highlight-searched-text.bimlas-sidebar .bimlas-next-match svg, .bimlas-highlight-searched-text.bimlas-sticky-find-in-page .bimlas-next-match svg {
  fill: green;
}
.bimlas-highlight-searched-text.bimlas-sidebar .bimlas-previous-match svg, .bimlas-highlight-searched-text.bimlas-sticky-find-in-page .bimlas-previous-match svg {
  fill: red;
}
```
